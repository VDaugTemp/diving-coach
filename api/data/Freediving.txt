FREEDIVING — SUPPLEMENTAL TRAINING & BODY AWARENESS GUIDE

This document focuses on areas that are often underexplained in standard freediving education:
how the body feels, how training adapts, and how to make better decisions around comfort,
progression, and safety. It is educational and assumes all water training is done with
appropriate supervision and safety protocols.

SECTION 1 — DRY TRAINING: PURPOSE AND LIMITS

Dry training is not lung training.
It is nervous system training.

The goal of dry apnea is to:
- reduce stress response to rising CO₂
- improve relaxation under discomfort
- build awareness of internal signals
- practice calm recovery breathing

Dry training does NOT:
- increase oxygen stores
- make blackout less likely
- replace in-water safety procedures

A dry session is successful if the diver finishes calm, not exhausted or frustrated.

SECTION 2 — CO₂ TOLERANCE: WHAT YOU ARE ACTUALLY TRAINING

CO₂ tolerance is the ability to remain relaxed as carbon dioxide rises.
The urge to breathe comes from CO₂, not lack of oxygen.

Key points:
- Early contractions are mechanical (diaphragm and chest)
- Later contractions are neurological (brain response to discomfort)
- Panic, not CO₂, is the main limiter for most beginners

Training principle:
If mental agitation rises faster than physical contractions, stop the session.

Progress is measured by calmer response, not longer breath holds.

SECTION 3 — OXYGEN AWARENESS (NON-HYPOXIC)

Low oxygen does not feel like suffocation.
It often feels like clarity, warmth, or emotional softness.

Possible early signs of low oxygen:
- narrowing of attention
- delayed reactions
- tingling in fingers or lips
- unusual calm or euphoria
- loss of fine motor control

Any loss of coordination or awareness ends the session immediately.

Dry training should never push into hypoxic territory.

SECTION 4 — BREATHING AND RELAXATION MECHANICS

Effective freediving breathing is quiet, slow, and unforced.

Key principles:
- long, passive exhales
- soft, unhurried inhales
- minimal chest lifting
- no breath stacking

Relaxation is physical first, mental second.
If the body is tense, the mind will follow.

SECTION 5 — THROAT AND AIRWAY CONTROL (PRACTICAL VIEW)

Airway control is about release, not force.

Useful mental models:
- the glottis acts like a valve, not a clamp
- excess tongue tension blocks airflow more than lack of air
- swallowing is a sign of misdirected control

If equalization or breath control requires effort, it will fail under pressure.

SECTION 6 — EQUALIZATION PRACTICE (DRY CONTEXT)

Dry equalization practice should:
- reduce effort
- improve timing awareness
- build coordination

It should not:
- involve force
- cause facial or throat tension
- be done to exhaustion

If dry practice requires pushing air, the pattern is unsafe for depth.

SECTION 7 — WEIGHTING: INTERNAL CALIBRATION

Correct weighting feels neutral and unremarkable.

Signs of appropriate weighting:
- descent is controlled, not fast
- ascent requires light effort
- surface buoyancy is positive and stable

Warning signs:
- heavy legs pulling you down → overweighted
- chest dropping suddenly → underweighted
- excitement during descent → too much weight or too much speed

Weighting should always be checked in water with supervision.

SECTION 8 — FREEFALL READINESS (AROUND 10–15 METERS)

Freefall begins when buoyancy becomes neutral or slightly negative.

Readiness cues:
- descent becomes quiet
- finning stops naturally
- body remains relaxed
- equalization stays effortless

If freefall feels thrilling, forced, or rushed, conditions are not appropriate.

SECTION 9 — DUCK DIVE MECHANICS (FUNCTIONAL VIEW)

The duck dive is not about strength.
It is about body alignment and timing.

Efficient duck dives:
- use body weight, not leg power
- preserve relaxation
- minimize oxygen cost

Poor duck dives increase stress, CO₂ buildup, and depth anxiety.

SECTION 10 — POOL VS DEPTH TRAINING DIFFERENCE

Pool training builds tolerance.
Depth training builds coordination under pressure.

Common mismatch:
Strong pool performance does not guarantee depth comfort.

Depth challenges often come from:
- timing errors
- equalization rhythm
- posture changes
- psychological load

SECTION 11 — YOGA AND MOBILITY FOR FREEDIVERS

Yoga for freediving is about breathing space, not flexibility extremes.

Priority areas:
- rib cage expansion (especially lateral)
- diaphragm release
- hip flexors (duck dive efficiency)
- thoracic spine mobility

Best styles:
- slow flow
- yin
- breath-focused sessions

Any yoga that raises heart rate before diving is counterproductive.

SECTION 12 — TRAINING LOAD AND RECOVERY

Freediving adaptation is slow and cumulative.

Signs of overreaching:
- irritability
- poor sleep
- shallow breathing
- increased anxiety around dives

Consistency beats intensity.
More sessions are not better if recovery is compromised.

SECTION 13 — PROGRESSION BEYOND COMFORT

Progression should be boring.

True readiness shows as:
- calm aborts
- stable recovery breathing
- emotional neutrality
- consistent technique

If a dive feels like an achievement, it was probably too much.

SECTION 14 — WHEN TO STOP A SESSION

End training immediately if:
- contractions become chaotic
- equalization degrades
- focus drops
- emotional urgency appears
- coordination changes

Stopping early is a skill, not a failure.
